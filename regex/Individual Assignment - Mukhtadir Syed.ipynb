He has not graduated from high school nor has he earned his GED. He has been working full time, steadily, since the age of 16. He recently left a job at jacobs engineering group where he worked for about 5 years. He started working at becton dickinson a few weeks ago. Referral to SMH was precipitated by pt seeing his PCP, Dr. Ford, for a physical and sharing concerns re: depression. He was having suicidal thoughts the week of 8/22/83 and noticed that his depression and anxiety symptoms were starting to interfere with work. Per Dr. Ford's recommendation, he contacted PAL for assistance. When screened for substance use, pt was referred to SMH for an intake. Pt was scheduled to be seen last week due to urgency of his depression and SI, but missed the intake appointment due to getting extremely intoxicated the night before. Pt presents today seeking individual therapy and psychiatry services to address longstanding depression.\\n</td>\n",

The first of these episodes occurred when facial meshing was placed on him during radiation therapy. He recalled the experience vividly and described \"freaking out\", involving a sensation of crushing in his chest, difficulty breathing, a fear that he could die, and intense emotional disquiet. The second episode occurred during the last 10-15 minutes of an MRI scan. Mr. Echeverria noted feeling surprised and fearful when the feelings of panic started.

       "107  Pt is a 21 year old, single, heterosexual identified, Liechtenstein male. He resides in Rabat, in a rented apartment, with a roommate. He has not graduated from high school nor has he earned his GED. He has been working full time, steadily, since the age of 16. He recently left a job at jacobs engineering group where he worked for about 5 years. He started working at becton dickinson a few weeks ago. Referral to SMH was precipitated by pt seeing his PCP, Dr. Ford, for a physical and sharing concerns re: depression. He was having suicidal thoughts the week of 8/22/83 and noticed that his depression and anxiety symptoms were starting to interfere with work. Per Dr. Ford's recommendation, he contacted PAL for assistance. When screened for substance use, pt was referred to SMH for an intake. Pt was scheduled to be seen last week due to urgency of his depression and SI, but missed the intake appointment due to getting extremely intoxicated the night before. Pt presents today seeking individual therapy and psychiatry services to address longstanding depression.\\n   \n",

She shared that she began restricting at age 11 yo but could not identify any specific triggers.  \"Mostly I wouldn't eat at school, and then I'd have dinner at home, but some days not,\" per pt. Her parents and ski coach started noticing that \"I wasn't eating and was losing weight.\"  She began outpatient treatment at age 11, and has been in and out of outpatient and higher levels of care since then, including multiple emergency room visits and against medical advice (AMA) departures.

She is seeking help mainly around management of anxiety, and it is unclear to what extent alcohol (which she has not consumed since May 2016) is affecting her current situation.  Biological factors include likely primary mood and/or anxiety disorders (perhaps depression with panic attacks), consequences of long-term alcohol use. Important psychological factors include the loss of three improtant family members and the prior trauma at multiple times. Her social situation reflects isolation and an unfortunately high level of dependence on her children.  One important challenge is her discomfort with opening up and seeking care, which may benefit from positive treatment alliances.\\n   \n",

Pt was seen in Lutheran Brethern Homes intake clinic.  Since her father's death, pt report worsening depression, poor sleep, fatigue, anxiety, and auditory hallucinations. Her auditory hallucinations consist of her father's voicing telling her to come with him, but she denies any commands to harm herself. Father died Oct 1986, mother died the year prior.  Sister died last year.  As a result of these voices patient's sleep has worsened. She denies suicidal ideation stating that she would never harm himself because of her youngest sons who live at home.\\n   \n",

She shared that she has recently lost a great deal of weight and is having difficulty meeting her calorie needs due to difficulties with gagging/swallowing, and aversions to specific food textures.  Specifically, since May 2012, she has lost 18 lbs, going from 128 lbs (BMI = 19.5, normal range) to 110.2 lbs (BMI = 16.8, underweight range) at a height of 5'8\" tall.  She has had amenorrhea for 2 months.  Her current weight is her lowest since high school, when she was a model and weighed 98 lbs (BMI = 14.9, underweight range).  At that time, she had amenorrhea, felt pressure to be thin in order to keep her job, and most likely met criteria for frank anorexia nervosa nervosa-restricting type.\\n   \n",

On these instances she usually wakes up exhausted.  She reports going to sleep around 8:30 or 9pm because her partner keeps an early schedule (wakes up at 4am), though she says she typically sleeps much later because she does not have to be at work until 10 am.  She reports enjoying activities, eating well, and having good energy and ability to concentrate.  She denies suicidal thoughts or self-injury since February 1989  (her last suicide attempt).  She denies thoughts of harming others or access to guns.  She denies current or prior symptoms of mania or psychosis.  She endorses drinking two glasses of wine per night, though on rare occasions she drinks three (usually when she \"overreacts\").  She states this has happened about 5 times in the past few months.

In Jun 2007 she was assessed at ASMC for vertigo which is worsened by stress and then later in the year she was twice seen in the Ronan Medical Clinic ED for chest pain with apparently negative cardiac work-up.  She describes both persisting generalized anxiety (feeling on edge, restless, worried) as well as episodic-like autonomic arousal (sweating, dizziness, chest tightness, chills) consistent with panic attacks.  These symptoms have worsened over the past year, and have only slightly helped by 0.5mg of lorazepam taken thrice daily.\\n   \n",

Pt. has almost no libido now and feels this may be impacting her marriage.  She can lubricate and get orgasm on occasion.  She has had some success with sexual fantasy in the past.  She has not followed through with a med trial of bupropion rx by Peggy Wiggins, MD because she was breast feeding at  the time.  Discussion of the complexity of the problem.  Advised she resume couple's therapy/indiv therapy or discuss with husband if he would be willing to come in for behaviorally-based sex therapy. Reading list given for her to explore options.

Pt described period of difficulty that started 10/2001 with lack of work as an copyeditor and a break up w a BF that spiraled into her dc of medications and decompensation of mental state, requiring extensive inpatient and residential care.  She feels she has recovered from that mental health relapse and is healthier at this time, putting greater focus on her overall health and well being, having positive supports and being honest w them about her functioning, and feeling a strong connection w her psychiatrist.  While pt has made great strides in improving her mental health, supports, and activities, there is concern w her level of distress and attachment related to the current relationship and how problems within that relationship could be risk factors for her decline in functioning.  Pt will benefit from a focus on interpersonal connections and how such does and does not relate to her own identity and functioning.  -Recommendations / Plan Level of Care: Outpatient\\n   \n",

Patient primary concern is related to a TBI experienced at bootcamp in 01/2007. He reports a fellow army recruit sucker punched him from behind and knocked him out immediately. He is not sure how long he was out for but the next thing he remembers he was in the ambulance going to the hospital. He reports problems since that time although it was hard to get a sense of the specific symptoms he is experiencing. He reports he tends to wake up in the middle of the night and feels like he is having a seizure and can't control his body. He will feel disoriented at times (not completely dissociative, but feels \"weird, out of my body.\" He also had headaches and feels lightheaded. He reports he has also been struggling with depression since the incident where he will have good days and down days. On the down days, he wants to sleep all day and not get out of bed.\\n   \n",
